You have to grab your audience\u0026rsquo;s attention there, and say whatever you want to say in the top part of the page, before the user needs to scroll down, because they rarely do!\u0026rdquo;\nThere has been plenty of evidence supporting this theory (see likes of which in here, here and here and as far as I know, this is still what\u0026rsquo;s being preached in BBC, and many prominent international media organizations.\nSo what should we do?\nYour blog post is a product And considering the evidence (read their conclusion as: \u0026ldquo;global short attention-span syndrome\u0026rdquo;) you need to come up with a product like a matchbox, rather than Swiss army knife. Simple, Small, to the point. A matchbox: simple, small, to the point\n  As a product you need to think about two main aspects:\na. Content (the idea itself, what is it that your \u0026ldquo;product\u0026rdquo; supposed to do)\nb. Form (packaging, how can you make sure that the \u0026ldquo;product\u0026rdquo; is bought, and also used)\na. Content You are a technical blogger (an assumed audience of this post) and have something to write about. I believe you need to answer these questions, before putting pen on paper (or fingertip on keyboard\u0026hellip; whatever)\n  What is the purpose of your post? Are you trying to spread the knowledge? educating people? or just blowing off steam about some bug you\u0026rsquo;ve come across? Do you actually want your post to be read by as many people as possible? or you\u0026rsquo;re happy as long as one or two like-minded people read it?\n  Consistency always raises your profile. Are you happy with being a part-time educator, part-time bug nagger? Or you actually prefer to be known by only one of them?\n  Have you thought about your audience? Who are they? Are they \u0026ldquo;Oracle Ace directors?\u0026rdquo; Are they supposed to be technically as able as you are? How you considered the fact that even among Oracle Ace Directors people have different abilities? Not everybody is an \u0026ldquo;Optimizer guru,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Recovery master,\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Replication genius\u0026rdquo;, and they all might still be Oracle Ace Directors. Do you care if someone reads your post and doesn\u0026rsquo;t understand it?\n  I found Tim Hall\u0026rsquo;s advice very insightful on many other matters concerning management of this creative process.\nb. Form You can find plenty of style-guides on the internet (here and here, for example). They seem to have a number of key elements in common:\n  Choose short \u0026amp; intriguing titles!\nMost of the blog posts are advertised via Twitter. So more compact title provides you with more room for hashtags to advertise your Tweet (and therefore your blog post) properly.\nDo consider concepts such as \u0026ldquo;impact\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;controversy\u0026rdquo; when you come up with a title. Avoid questions in titles; that\u0026rsquo;s generally frowned upon in the world of \u0026ldquo;proper\u0026rdquo; journalism.\n  ALWAYS write short sentences, and short paragraphs. A Bad blog post!\n  BBC World Service\u0026rsquo;s guideline was \u0026ldquo;one sentence is enough in a paragraph,\u0026rdquo; and if you read news on BBC\u0026rsquo;s website, you can see how it looks.\nNobody likes going through tens of uninterrupted lines of writing; especially on technical blogs which are usually wider than normal to avoid line-wraps when including programming code (or \u0026ldquo;execution plans\u0026rdquo; among Oracle bloggers).\n  Audience has a limited patience!\nJust because you\u0026rsquo;re a WhateverCon celebrity, they won\u0026rsquo;t read your massively long post. Keep it short! (Unlike what I\u0026rsquo;ve done here, in my post!) But if you can\u0026rsquo;t,\u0026hellip;\n  Break your post into little pieces.\nI suggest using sub-headers religiously. It can make the scanning eyes of your readers stop, and pay attention to what you want them to pay attention to.\nAlso think about the flow of your post. If you can use ordered lists as your sub-headers, do it.\n  Use any tool that\u0026rsquo;s available at your disposal to make your post less boring: images, links, unordered lists, Alex Gorbatchev\u0026rsquo;s SyntaxHighlighter.\nYou might think that your audience are too sophisticated for such \u0026ldquo;marketing tricks,\u0026rdquo; but unfortunately we all (at least the more fortunate ones) can only read with our eyes. If the eyes don\u0026rsquo;t like something they see, they try not to see it!\n  Remove distractions from your blog post, as much as possible.\nSo you are an OCA and an OCP and an OCM and an Oracle Certified Expert on something and you get tons of traffic that tens of companies want to advertise through your website? Sure, but every time someone visits your page and the content of your post isn\u0026rsquo;t the first thing that their eyes meet, you\u0026rsquo;ve effectively lost a reader.\nExamples:\n Horrible reading experience: any post on KDNuggest Pleasant reading experience: any post on Towards Data Science    Start with an abstract/introduction.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t waste your readers\u0026rsquo; time by not stating the aim of your post, because if you make them go through it and they find out that it\u0026rsquo;s not what they were looking for, they will hesitate to come back to your blog.\nAlso people usually don\u0026rsquo;t scroll down! If you don\u0026rsquo;t present your idea in an exciting manner in the first two or three sentences, they\u0026rsquo;ll simply leave your post!\n  A \u0026ldquo;Conclusion\u0026rdquo; part is as important as the \u0026ldquo;abstract/introduction.\u0026rdquo;\n   Making your blog Mobile-Aware increases your exposure\n  Making your blog Mobile-Aware increases your exposure\nUse meta tags or anything else that can help your post appear in search engines when looking for a related word/phrase.\nAlso I need to echo Julian Dyke\u0026rsquo;s advice (thanks to Martin Widlake for reminding me of it): For better exposure you need to make your blog mobile-aware. Google announced on 26th February, 2015 how they\u0026rsquo;re changing their search engine\u0026rsquo;s criteria to give higher rankings to Mobile-aware blogs and sites. Also guidelines to test, and the definition of \u0026ldquo;mobile-awareness\u0026rdquo; is included in the statement.\n  Conclusion Technical bloggers seem to read blogs in two circumstances, generally:\n When they\u0026rsquo;re looking for a solution to their own problem (i.e. when they read a blog post they keep saying in their head: \u0026ldquo;cut the bullshit!\u0026quot;) At night, after they\u0026rsquo;re finished with day to day stuff. (i.e. their eyes and brains are too tired to spend a lot of energy to go through your \u0026ldquo;jewel of a post\u0026rdquo; line by line, and word by word.)  If you don\u0026rsquo;t engage with them as soon as they start reading the title of your post and don\u0026rsquo;t make the whole experience of reading your post as comforting (and informative) at the same time, You have effectively wasted your time!\n","description":"","id":2,"section":"posts","tags":null,"title":"Nobody Reads Your Blog!","uri":"https://babak4.github.io/posts/nobody-reads-your-blog/"}]
