        <description>Dear Reader!
I hereby declare that the material published in this blog have no other purpose, but to remind me about those aspects of the technologies that I use on a daily basis - to earn money, primarily - but I tend to forget quickly.
Also I hope that the posts could help finding [possible] solutions easier on the web, by simply spreading the word, and increasing the exposure of posts&amp;rsquo; subjects to search engines such as Google.</description>

        <description>Yes, nobody!
I mean: REALLY read it; going through all the words and sentences and paragraphs and get through to the end.
During the time that I was working for BBC World Service (2002-2012) one of the more important guidelines for online content producers was: &amp;ldquo;All you have to play with is the first page, and in fact, first paragraph of your piece. You have to grab your audience&amp;rsquo;s attention there, and say whatever you want to say in the top part of the page, before the user needs to scroll down, because they rarely do!</description>
